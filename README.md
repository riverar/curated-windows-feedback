This experimental issues-only repository contains feedback originally submitted by ordinary users to Microsoft via its Feedback Hub application on Windows PCs.

Reports are automatically piped into GitHub Issues and reviewed by a few community members. If the issue is reproducible, it is labeled as such. Otherwise in all other cases (e.g. unactionable, unreadable) it's closed.
